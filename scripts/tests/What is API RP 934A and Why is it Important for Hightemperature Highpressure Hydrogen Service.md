# What is API RP 934-A and Why is it Important for High-temperature, High-pressure Hydrogen Service?
  
API RP 934-A is a recommended practice (RP) published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) that covers materials and fabrication requirements for new 2Â¼Cr and 3Cr steel heavy wall pressure vessels for high-temperature, high-pressure hydrogen service. These vessels are used in hydroprocessing units, such as hydrotreating and hydrocracking, where hydrogen is used to remove impurities and improve the quality of petroleum products.

For this RP, "heavy wall" is defined as a shell thickness of 4 in. (100 mm) or greater, and high-temperature is considered to be operating temperatures of 650 Â°F (345 Â°C) and above. These conditions pose significant challenges for the design, fabrication, and operation of pressure vessels, as they can cause hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, creep, and fatigue of the materials.
  
API RP 934-A provides guidance on how to select the appropriate materials, perform adequate testing, apply proper welding procedures, control heat treatment, inspect welds, and prevent damage mechanisms for these vessels. The RP applies to vessels that are designed, fabricated, certified, and documented in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 2, including Paragraph 3.4, Supplemental Requirements for Cr-Mo Steels, and ASME Code Case 2151, as applicable.
  
Materials covered by this RP are conventional steels including standard 2Â¼Cr-1Mo and 3Cr-1Mo steels, and advanced steels which include 2Â¼Cr-1Mo-Â¼V, 3Cr-1Mo-Â¼V-Ti-B, and 3Cr-1Mo-Â¼V-Nb-Ca steels. These steels have enhanced properties such as higher strength, toughness, and resistance to hydrogen attack compared to carbon steel. The RP also covers the use of austenitic stainless steel weld overlay lining or stainless clad lining to provide additional corrosion resistance for the interior surfaces of these vessels.
  
The RP was first published in December 2000 as API 934. The third edition was published in January 2019 and includes updates on material specifications, fabrication methods, inspection techniques, and damage prevention practices based on the latest industry experience and research. The RP also includes an errata issued in 2021 that corrects some typographical errors and clarifies some requirements.
  
API RP 934-A is an essential document for anyone involved in the design, fabrication, inspection, or operation of heavy wall pressure vessels for high-temperature, high-pressure hydrogen service. It provides best practices and recommendations to ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of these vessels. The RP can be downloaded as a PDF file from the API website or other online sources.
  
## How to Apply API RP 934-A for Heavy Wall Pressure Vessels
  
API RP 934-A provides a comprehensive set of requirements and recommendations for the materials and fabrication of heavy wall pressure vessels for high-temperature, high-pressure hydrogen service. However, the RP is not intended to replace the engineering judgment and experience of the users, designers, fabricators, inspectors, and operators of these vessels. The RP also acknowledges that there may be alternative methods or practices that can achieve the same or better results than those specified in the RP.
  
Therefore, it is important to understand the scope and limitations of the RP and how to apply it properly for each specific case. The following are some key points to consider when using API RP 934-A:
  
- The RP covers new vessels only. It does not cover existing vessels that may need repair, modification, or rerating. However, the RP can be used as a resource for such cases, with changes defined by the purchaser.
- The RP covers vessels with a shell thickness of 4 in. (100 mm) or greater and operating at temperatures of 650 Â°F (345 Â°C) and above. However, the RP can also be used as a resource for vessels with lower thicknesses and/or temperatures, with changes defined by the purchaser.
- The RP covers vessels made of conventional and advanced Cr-Mo steels. It does not cover vessels made of enhanced steels (such as ASME SA-542, Grade B, Class 4) or other materials. However, the RP can be used as a reference document for such cases, at the purchaser's discretion.
- The RP covers vessels with an austenitic stainless steel weld overlay lining or stainless clad lining. It does not cover vessels with other types of linings or multilayer vessels. However, the RP can be used as a reference document for such cases, at the purchaser's discretion.
- The RP applies to vessels that are designed, fabricated, certified, and documented in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 2. It does not apply to vessels that are designed, fabricated, certified, and documented in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 1 or Division 3. However, the RP can be used as a reference document for such cases, at the purchaser's discretion.
- The RP provides guidance on how to prevent common damage mechanisms for these vessels, such as hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, creep, and fatigue. However, the RP does not cover all possible damage mechanisms that may occur in these vessels. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a thorough risk assessment and damage analysis for each vessel and apply appropriate mitigation measures.

By following these points and using API RP 934-A correctly, users can ensure that their heavy wall pressure vessels for high-temperature, high-pressure hydrogen service are designed, fabricated, inspected, and operated in a safe and reliable manner.
